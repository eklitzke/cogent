Simple memory caching service using GLib.

The long term goal of this is to leverage Tim Janik's awesome slice allocator
in a cache system. This is allocator is neat because it's designed to be fast,
scalable, and multithreading friendly. This means that it should be easier to
make a highly-concurrent memcached-like service that leverages the power,
simplicity, and speed of GLib.

I'm still prototyping everything (as evidenced by the fact that the protocol
version is 0!) and evaluating if this is even feasible, i.e. how fast this will
be compared to memcached.

This software is licensed under a BSD license, but it links against software
that uses other licenses (namely, GLib and Python).
